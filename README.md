# Synthetic-Exposure-Fusion

Implementation of paper "Automatic exposure compensation using an image segmentation method for single-image-based multi-exposure fusion" by
Yuma Kinoshita and Hitoshi Kiya

-  Single image is given as input
-  Multiple synthetic images with varying exposures are generated
- Synthetic images are combined using Exposure Fusion by Mertens

Results are in imgs folder

There are some problems in implementation that need to be addressed. prob.jpg is an example of it.
